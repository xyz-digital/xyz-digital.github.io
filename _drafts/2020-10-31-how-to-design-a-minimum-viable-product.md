title: How to Design a Minimum Viable Product

Coming up with app ideas is one of my favorite things to do. I have countless drawings and doodles of apps that do all kinds of things. Almost none of them have seen the light of day. In this article, I present how you can overcome this by designing a minimum viable product (MVP) note taking web application.

## Minimum Viable Product

A minimum viable product includes the bare minimum set of features that will be of some use to possible customers. This method of development has been popularized by Eric Ries' [The Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/).

## Product Hypothesis

When building something new you should have some hypothesis for why your product would be used over others. The MVP is the quickest way to test this hypothesis. Your goal should be to focus on building only the things required to test whether your belief is correct. Once you have that answer you can move on to you next hypothesis.

## Functionality

Deciding what functionality is required to test this hypothesis is a crucial part of designing the MVP. Each new feature you think of should be held up against the hypothesis. If it isn't directly contributing to answering that question, then it should be left for later.

### User Stories

A user story is a natural language description of how a feature should work from the end-user's perspective. It typically includes:

	- Who is the story for?
	- What is expected?
	- Why it is important?

User stories usually follow a format of "As a [who], I want to [what], so that [why]".

## Design

Once you have boiled down the minimum set of functionality, the next step is to design how it will look. The functional requirements may sound simple, but they likely already require multiple new interactive elements that need to be identified and placed.

## Marketing

 In order to test the hypothesis you need some form of marketing to bring people to your application in order to gather feedback. Blog posts, social media, and advertising are some of the ways you can drive people to your new product. 

## Deploy

Getting your product ready to be used by others is one of the major early challenges of a minimum viable product. Web applications fall on the easier side of things, however they still require setting up a domain, server, and database to support the application.  Other distribution methods have their own challenges. Deploying to one or both of the mobile app stores requires several more steps and potentially a certification process. Where possible, I would advise starting with a web application, unless you have plenty of experience with other distribution methods.

## Release Early, Release Often

One of the goals of building a minimum viable product is reducing the batch size of work. Much like the lean manufacturing process this forces you to go through the full process much sooner and identify possible challenges sooner. Each time something new is added it will follow a similar process. This allows you to practice all aspects of product development. Each time you complete a release cycle you will learn something new that will help you for next time.
